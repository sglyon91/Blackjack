    "\n",
    "Blackjack is a widely popular and ostensibly simple card game that appears at nearly every American casino. Despite its perceived simplicity, there are a number of strategies one can take to improve one's odds against the dealer, who, by design, has the natural advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of assumptions that I outline in the \"Background\" section below, I explore some of these strategies throughtout this project. As one might expect, the more advanced the strategy, the more likely it is to beat the dealer. Here I will define \"advanced\" as: the player incorporates additional facets of the game beyond \"hit\" and \"stay\" and/or the player strategically bases each decision on the specific cards he holds as well as the one card the dealer has showing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project assumes a basic understanding of the rules of blackjack. This site will be helpful to fill in any gaps:\n",

    "### 2. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some assumptions I used for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The game uses one deck of cards, which is reshuffled after each game iteration.\n",
    "2. Cards are taken from this deck without replacement until the deck is reshuffled.\n",
    "3. The dealer abides by the usual rules.\n",
    "4. The player uses various strategies which I will outline as they come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a list of 52 integers to represent the deck, with each integer corresponding to one of the 52 cards in a standard deck. I utilized functions from the random package to randomly select cards as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll explain some of the necessary component functions and then proceed to the strategies."

    "Below, I try out each of the strategies. For each strategy, I use a for loop with 100000 iterations; each iteration is generally equivalent to one hand for the dealer and one hand for the player, although sometimes a player is granted an additonal hand(s) in a given iteration through splitting. Within each iteration, I create a new deck of cards and randomly sample as necessary, each time without setting a seed. This makes each iteration independent of the others.\n",

The result of each hand (i.e. the amount of money the player won) is appended to a list, and after the 100000 iterations are complete, the sum of the list is calculated. This shows, for each strategy, how much money the player would expect to make after 100000 iterations. I then calculate the expected value of each strategy by dividing the sum by the number of hands. Each output below is the sum followed by the expected value."

What I did not necessarily expect is that the advanced strategy would net a long term result greater than zero. This may be due to my assumptions, which are not standard across casinos. For example, many casinos these days use multiple decks instead of one, and they may also use a different shuffling methodology. In a future project, I could explore these potentialities along with the player's ability to count cards."
